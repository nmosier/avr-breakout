TODO

-2. (TODO) use canvas_fill_rectangle for drawing paddle, of course!
-1. (TODO) canvas_fill_rectangle should take BOUNDS as parameter.
0. (TODO) Factor out commonalities for project_round and project_down.
1. (TODO) Create global cleanup update queue for objpool.
2. (TODO) redefine object definitions as macros.

Object Collision
- passive: function pointer -- handle collisions of other objects into this object.
           - e.g. GRID will have different collision function from generic object.
- active: function pointer -- collide into other objects. Probably can be standard function.

``Object'' struct:
 - collide_passive
 - collide_active
 - bounds
 - velocity

Object pool: contains array of all objects. At each tick, each object is collided with all other
             objects and then its velocity is updated.


WAIT. The objects needn't even have bounds. Need to distinguish between the types.
